VS Code MCP Test Results
Test Time: 2025-05-31T17:26:15.857Z

If VS Code is properly connected to the MCP server, you should be able to use
the MCP network tools (ping, nslookup, etc.) from VS Code.

To test the connection, try using the ping tool by running:
1. Open VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Type "MCP: Execute Tool"
3. Select "mcp-open-discovery-test" server
4. Select "ping" tool
5. Enter parameters: {"host": "example.com", "count": 3}

If successful, you should see ping results from example.com.
If you get a "Method not found" error, check VS Code's Developer Tools for details.
