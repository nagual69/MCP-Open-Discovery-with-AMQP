# MCP Open Discovery Test Suite

This directory previously contained a test suite for validating the MCP Open Discovery server functionality and MCP protocol compliance.

**Note:** As of June 5, 2025, all legacy test scripts (including `test_mcp_client.js`) have been archived to the `archive/` directory and are no longer maintained in the main project. If you need to reference or restore these scripts, see `archive/test_tools_cleanup_2025-06-05.txt` for details.

## Test Scripts (Archived)

The following test scripts have been archived:

- `test_mcp_client.js`
- `create_test_tools.js`
- `direct_test_tools.js`
- `vscode_mcp_test.js`
- `vscode_mcp_test_results.txt`

## Running Tests (Deprecated)

The previous test workflow is now deprecated. If you wish to run or review the old tests, retrieve the scripts from the `archive/` directory and follow the instructions within those files.

## MCP Compliance Checks

The MCP Open Discovery server continues to be validated for compliance with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification through manual and automated integration tests as part of the main development workflow.

## Troubleshooting

If you have questions about legacy tests or need to restore any archived scripts, refer to the `archive/` directory or contact the project maintainers.
