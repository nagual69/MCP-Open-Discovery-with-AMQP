# VS Code MCP Tools Test

This file contains detailed information to help troubleshoot VS Code MCP integration issues.

## Current Status

VS Code is connecting to our MCP server but not detecting any tools. 

## Expected Format for tools/list Response

VS Code expects the response to the `tools/list` method to have a specific format. 
Here's what our server is now returning (MCP spec):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "tools": [...],
  "id": 1
}
```

- The `tools` property is an array of tool definitions.
- There is no `result` property in the response.

## Debugging Tips

1. Check the VS Code Developer Tools (Help > Toggle Developer Tools) for network requests
2. Look for requests to http://localhost:3000 and examine the response
3. Check the MCP server logs for any errors or messages
4. Test direct API calls using PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000" -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

## Solution Possibilities

1. Make sure the `tools/list` response returns only the `tools` property (no `result`)
2. Try restarting VS Code after server changes
3. Ensure the server properly announces its tools capability in the `initialize` response
4. Check for any schema validation issues in the tool definitions

## Tool Test

If VS Code can detect tools, try using ping:

1. Command Palette: "MCP: Execute Tool"
2. Select "mcp-open-discovery-test" server
3. Select "ping" tool
4. Parameters: `{"host": "example.com", "count": 3}`

Expected output: Ping results from example.com
