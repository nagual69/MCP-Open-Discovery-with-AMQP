# Test Script Improvements

## Fixed Issues

1. **Syntax Errors** - Fixed syntax errors in the test_comprehensive.js script:

   - Removed a stray bracket causing a syntax error
   - Fixed duplicate closing braces and catch blocks

2. **Command Line Argument Handling** - Improved command line argument handling:

   - Added support for `--include=tool1,tool2` to only test specific tools
   - Added support for `--exclude=tool1,tool2` to exclude specific tools
   - Added support for `--debug` to show more detailed debug information
   - Fixed handling of group filtering

3. **Dependency Tracking** - Added proper dependency tracking:

   - Tools can now depend on other tools using the `dependsOn` property
   - Tests are skipped if their dependencies failed or were not run
   - Results are tracked in a global object for reference

4. **Output Improvements**:

   - Added more detailed group summaries including skipped tests count
   - Added condensed result output to avoid flooding the console
   - Added debug mode for more detailed information
   - Fixed process exit codes for proper script integration

5. **Test Organization**:

   - Organized tests by group using the test's group property instead of name filtering
   - Added additional Proxmox tools for comprehensive testing

6. **Documentation**:
   - Created a TESTING.md file with comprehensive documentation on how to use the test scripts
   - Added examples and explanations for all options

## Additional Tools

Added the following tools to the test suite:

1. **Proxmox Tools**:
   - `proxmox_get_vm_details`
   - `proxmox_get_container_details`
   - `proxmox_get_metrics`

## Notes

- The script now properly handles tools that are marked to skip
- Improved reporting with group and overall summaries
- Added support for selective testing of tool groups
- Fixed parameter conflicts and missing required parameters in tool definitions
