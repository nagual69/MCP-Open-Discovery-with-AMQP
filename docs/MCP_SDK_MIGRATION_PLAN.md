2. `tools/nmap_tools.js` - 4 tools (ping scan, TCP connect, TCP SYN, UDP scan, version scan)
3. `tools/memory_tools.js` - 4 tools (get, set, merge, query)
4. `tools/proxmox_tools.js` - 12+ tools (credential management, cluster operations)
5. `tools/snmp_module.js` - 15+ tools (SNMP operations)

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### Step 1.1: Install Zod Dependency

```bash
npm install zod
```

#### Step 1.2: Create Tool Registration Helper

Create `tools/sdk_tool_registry.js` to centralize SDK tool registration patterns.

#### Step 1.3: Convert Network Tools

## Phase 5.5: Nagios Integration and MCP Tools vs Resources Analysis ✅ COMPLETED

### Context

As part of expanding discovery and monitoring integrations, we successfully implemented comprehensive support for the Nagios XI API. This implementation followed a thorough analysis of how to optimally model monitoring/discovery data in MCP using both Tools and Resources.

### Analysis: Tools vs Resources for Monitoring/Discovery ✅ IMPLEMENTED

Our analysis determined the optimal patterns for different types of monitoring and discovery functionality:

- **MCP Tools** are best for dynamic, parameterized queries and actions (e.g., fetch host/service status, query events, trigger checks).
- **MCP Resources** are best for exposing static or streamable data (e.g., event logs, inventory snapshots, config dumps) that can be read or subscribed to by clients.
- **Prompts** can be used to guide users/LLMs through common workflows, possibly embedding resources.

#### Implementation Results for Nagios (and similar monitoring systems):

| Data/Functionality               | MCP Tool? | MCP Resource? | Implementation Status                    |
| -------------------------------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Get status for a specific host   | ✅ Yes    | No            | `nagios_get_host_status` tool            |
| Get all host statuses (snapshot) | ✅ Yes    | ✅ Yes        | Tool + inventory resource                |
| Fetch recent event log entries   | ✅ Yes    | ✅ Yes        | `nagios_get_events` + event log resource |
| Stream event log                 | No        | ✅ Yes        | Event log resource with real-time data   |
| Get full config dump             | ✅ Yes    | ✅ Yes        | `nagios_get_config` + config resource    |
| Acknowledge alert                | ✅ Yes    | No            | `nagios_acknowledge_alert` action        |

### Successful Implementation
