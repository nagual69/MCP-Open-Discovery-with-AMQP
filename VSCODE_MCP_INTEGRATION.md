# VS Code MCP Integration Guide

## The Problem You Encountered

VS Code's MCP extension was trying to connect to `http://localhost:3000/` but our MCP server endpoint is at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`. Additionally, **VS Code's MCP extension typically expects stdio transport, not HTTP**.

## âœ… Solution 1: Stdio Transport (Recommended)

Configure VS Code to use stdio transport, which is the standard for VS Code MCP integrations:

### Step 1: Add to VS Code Settings

Open VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`) and add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "mcp-open-discovery": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "c:\\Users\\nagua\\OneDrive\\Documents\\development\\mcp-open-discovery\\mcp_server_multi_transport_sdk.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT_MODE": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Restart VS Code

Restart VS Code for the MCP server configuration to take effect.

### Step 3: Verify Connection

- Open VS Code Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Look for MCP-related commands
- The server should now connect via stdio transport

## ðŸ”„ Solution 2: Fix HTTP Endpoint (Alternative)

If you need HTTP transport for VS Code, we've added a root endpoint handler. But you'd need to configure VS Code to use `http://localhost:3000/mcp` specifically.

## ðŸ§ª Testing Both Transports

You can now test both transport modes:

### Stdio Transport (for VS Code)

```bash
# Start in stdio mode
TRANSPORT_MODE=stdio node mcp_server_multi_transport_sdk.js
```

### HTTP Transport (for MCP Inspector)

```bash
# Start in HTTP mode
TRANSPORT_MODE=http node mcp_server_multi_transport_sdk.js

# Then use MCP Inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

### Both Transports (simultaneous)

```bash
# Start in both modes
TRANSPORT_MODE=both node mcp_server_multi_transport_sdk.js
```

## ðŸ“‹ VS Code Configuration File

I've created a sample configuration file for you at `vscode-mcp-config.json` that you can reference.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation

**Use stdio transport for VS Code integration** - this is the standard approach and will work reliably with VS Code's MCP extension. Reserve HTTP transport for web-based tools like MCP Inspector or when you need to integrate with web applications.

## âœ… Expected VS Code Integration

Once configured correctly with stdio transport, you should see:

1. **No more 404 errors** in the VS Code console
2. **MCP server initializes successfully**
3. **All 42 tools available** through VS Code MCP commands
4. **Proper request/response handling** via stdin/stdout

The key insight is that VS Code MCP extensions are designed for stdio transport, while HTTP transport is better suited for web-based integrations and testing tools like MCP Inspector.
