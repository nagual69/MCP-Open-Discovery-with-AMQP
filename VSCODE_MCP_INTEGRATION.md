# VS Code MCP Integration Summary

## Changes Made to Fix MCP Server Integration

We've identified and fixed the issue with VS Code's MCP client integration. The problem was that VS Code was expecting certain JSON-RPC methods that weren't implemented in our MCP server. Specifically, we've added support for:

1. The `initialize` method - A VS Code-specific method used during the initial connection
2. The `tools/config` method - Used to configure tool behavior
3. Additional MCP protocol methods for better client compatibility

## How to Test the Connection

1. Make sure the Docker container is running:

   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\nagua\OneDrive\Documents\development\mcp-open-discovery"
   docker-compose ps
   ```

2. Verify the server is accessible by checking the health endpoint:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/health" -Method Get
   ```

3. In VS Code:

   - Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
   - Type "MCP: List Servers" and select the command
   - You should see "mcp-open-discovery-test" in the list of servers
   - Select it to connect to the server

4. Test a network tool:
   - Open the Command Palette again
   - Type "MCP: Execute Tool" and select the command
   - Select "mcp-open-discovery-test" server
   - Select "ping" tool
   - Enter parameters: `{"host": "example.com", "count": 3}`
   - You should see ping results from example.com

## Debugging Tips

If you encounter issues, you can:

1. Check the server logs:

   ```powershell
   docker-compose logs
   ```

2. Verify the VS Code settings in settings.json:

   ```json
   "mcp": {
     "servers": {
       "mcp-open-discovery-test": {
         "url": "http://localhost:3000"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run the test client to verify the server is working correctly:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\nagua\OneDrive\Documents\development\mcp-open-discovery"
   node test_mcp_client.js
   ```

## Implementation Details

The key changes made to `mcp_server.js` were:

1. Added support for the `initialize` method with proper LSP-style initialization response
2. Added support for the `tools/config` method to configure tool behavior
3. Improved error handling and logging for better debugging
4. Enhanced the server to handle VS Code's specific MCP protocol extensions

These changes ensure compatibility with VS Code's MCP client implementation while maintaining the core functionality of the Busybox network tools.
